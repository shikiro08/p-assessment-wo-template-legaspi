Luo Geh Manufactirung

I am Deniell L. Legaspi, a graduate in Computer Engineering. While I have a programming background, my skills are basic. I understand program flow, but I find it difficult to build complex programs I did build my thesis myself with the help of youtube and AI from scratch and often rely on my old programs with similar structures. However, I am good at following instructions, and this program is based on my understanding. I also rely on AI to supplement my skills, but I am eager to gain experience to become a professional software engineer. Thank you for taking the time to review my work. (This is my own word but AI fix the grammar)
