Legaspi Inventory Prototype 
Luo Geh Manufactirung

I am Deniell L. Legaspi, a graduate in Computer Engineering. While I have a programming background, my skills are basic. I understand program flow, but I find it difficult to build complex programs I did build my thesis myself with the help of youtube and AI from scratch and often rely on my old programs with similar structures. However, I am good at following instructions, and this program is based on my understanding. I also rely on AI to supplement my skills, but I am eager to gain experience to become a professional software engineer. Thank you for taking the time to review my work. (This is my own word but AI fix the grammar)

## Prerequisites

1. **XAMPP or Equivalent Server:**
   - Install XAMPP or any other local server application (such as WAMP, MAMP, etc.) to run the PHP application. XAMPP is recommended as it includes Apache server, PHP, and MySQL.

2. **PHP and MySQL:**
   - Ensure that PHP and MySQL are installed and properly configured in your server application.


Instruction:

1. inorder for this to run you must install a xampp application or any other server application. 
 -After the installation once you open the xampp application you can see a 5 services inorder to run the application you have have to start both apache and MySQL and leave the rest inactive. 
 -u can access the phpmyadmin by searching it through web or click the admin button beside the MySQL Config button.

2. download all the file inside the repository and save it to the htdocs folder inside the xampp. 

3. inside the config folder you can find the sql file named 'lougeh_db (1)' as the database import it in the http://localhost/phpmyadmin/  to create the database


4. inside the documentary you can find the ERD and DFD of the sytem to understand how it works

5. after importing the sql file you can now run the program by navigating the localhost 

## Functionality

- The application currently supports the **Add/Create** one of the functions of the CRUD(Create, Read, update, Delete) functionality.
- Future functionalities and updates will be added in subsequent versions.

## Documentation

- **ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram):** Located in the `documentation` folder.
- **DFD (Data Flow Diagram):** Also located in the `documentation` folder.
- Review these documents to understand the system architecture and data flow.

## Additional Information

- Make sure the XAMPP server is running both Apache and MySQL services.
- Verify that the database connection settings in `configs/db.php` are correct if modifications are needed.
